  abstract={Social networks provide more information on trends, ideas, and emotions during any such traumatic event as natural disasters. This paper proposes a model that monitors specific hashtag-related tweets, identifies the actual disaster tweet, and extracts meaningful data on disaster tweets, such as location and keywords. Government and organizations can use this data to support financial help, emergency evacuation, and volunteer. Monitoring Twitter and collecting data from many disaster periods, and analyze those data. This analysis data finds out where the Twitter users send the most catastrophic tweets and the most devastating event. An API developed from this data. This API served the disaster related location and corresponding disaster rate. A web app was developed based on the API. It detects the user’s location and displays the disaster statistics messages such as the disaster level related to the user’s area. Then users can receive this message via email or SMS by providing their phone numbers and emails. This work’s main objective is to identify the accurate disaster-related tweet by monitoring Twitter during the disaster and extracting meaningful data.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
